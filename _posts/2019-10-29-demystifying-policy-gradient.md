In the last blog post I explained what is a particle filter and how we can build one using pygame and python.In this post, I will walk you through the steps to build a 2D robotic car and get it running using PD control.

I am building visual demonstration of the problems given in Udacity's Course on Artificial Intelligence for Robotics.You can find the implementation code <a href='https://github.com/ioarun/ai-for-robotics-udacity/blob/master/visual-implementation/racetrack-control.py'>here</a>.

You can find the implementation code and the racetrack image that I have used <a href='https://github.com/ioarun/ai-for-robotics-udacity/blob/master/visual-implementation/racetrack-control.py'>here</a>.I hope you found this post helpful.Until next time!
